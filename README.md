> Banking App simple model of a banking application that is easy and quick to understand: [baking-app](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7213913533342769152/).

## About the application 📁
This is one of my small projects in which I intend to create an application that simulates a banking app through my knowledge in C#, such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Interfaces, among other fundamentals.
The program is NOT yet complete, but I will certainly improve it and finish it.

## Updates 🆙

1. Added ReadPassword method to mask password input with asterisks in console applications
