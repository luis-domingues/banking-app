# Banking App

> This project is under development ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Updates üÜô
1. 'Balance' attribute changed to `public` to allow access in 'ShowBalance' method.
2. Initialization of the account balance in the 'ClientAccount' class constructor.
3. Adjustment in the ShowBalance method to display the actual value of the account balance.
4. Implementation of the 'WithdrawMoney' method to make withdrawals from the account, with balance validation and error handling.
5. Implemented 'FormatException' exception handling for invalid entries in the main menu.

## About the application üìÅ
This is one of my small projects in which I intend to create an application that simulates a banking app through my knowledge in C#, such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Interfaces, among other fundamentals.
The program is NOT yet complete, but I will certainly improve it and finish it.

## Technologies used üîß
**[.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)** Version 6.0 or higher.
